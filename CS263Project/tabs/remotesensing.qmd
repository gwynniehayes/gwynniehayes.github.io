This first app is a program I made that takes the input of an image that the user can upload, then it makes the image into a raster and averages out the colors in the image into a specified number of groups. The output of this program can detect buildings and trees in images which is similar to what remote sensing can do. This however is a much more manual process then what machine learning in remote sensing can do.

This is package that is accessible in R, called "osmdata" that detects specific things in a map in a specified location. It can detect buildings, roads, water, forests and many other things.

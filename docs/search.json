    "text": "Introduction\nOne of my favorite bands is called Illuminati Hotties, what I love about them is that all the songs are very different and unique. The main artist is named Sarah Tudzin and in her professional life she is a music producer for many much more popular artists. She also writes and produces her own music and what I think is really cool about it is she just has fun making a bunch of cool and unique sounds, that aren’t dictated by someone else.\nSome of my friends and I went to a concert for another artist called Pom Pom Squad almost 4 years ago at this point where we were first introduced to her and have been hooked ever since, one of the things we always talk about is the uniqueness of her music and the interesting and sometimes slightly disturbing lyrics she uses in her songs. This led me to wanting to do a text analysis of her song lyrics.\n\n\n\nData!\nThere was not a data set of her song lyrics as she is not a very famous artist so i made the maybe silly decision to scrape all the lyrics off the web myself and make my own data set. I did all of this in a document called MP4_cleaning.qmd because it was a lot of code that was not important to the actual project results, it is however linked in my github and on this website page.\nWhat I did was used the web page scraping functions that we made in class to make a similar function that I could input the names of the songs into. I first tried to do all the songs at once but was running into issues with my IP address getting blocked from requesting too much data so I had to break down the songs into smaller requests and I made 10 individual csv files that I then bind_row() into one full data set. This however was only the names of the songs and the lyrics and I wanted an album name which was a little more complicated because the website I used to get the lyrics did not have the album name on the page that the song lyrics were on. So I just did a bunch of if else statements to add the new column. This definitely was not the most efficient method of doing this but its what I did because it was more familiar for a part of the project that was completely unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSong\nword\nalbum\n\n\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nall\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nmy\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nfavorite\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nsocks\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nare\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\ngetting\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what the data set looks like after I read it into this document and did some final cleaning!\n\nIlluminati Hotties have 5 albums and a couple singles that I am analyzing together as one “album”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Me Do One More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree I.H: This is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\nSome things I want to explore with in this data set are:\n\nMost common words in general, in each song and in each album\nSentient analysis of each album\nNetwork Graph and Correlation\n\n\n\n\nWord Counts\nI first wanted to just look at the most common word in all of her songs in general and found what was expected, words like “I”, “you” and “the” were the most commonly used words.\n\n\n\nMost Common Words for All Songs\n\n\nalbum\nword\nn\n\n\n\n\nPower\ni\n121\n\n\nlet me do one more\ni\n113\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\ni\n100\n\n\nSingle\ni\n70\n\n\nFREE I.H: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\nyou\n59\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\nyou\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo look at just the most common useful words I anti_joined my data set with the set of of smart stop words.

Also compared to the vibe of the song they sentiment seems to be all over the place. Something I would love to do in the future is add variables that relate to the “vibe” of the song similar to the Spotify data that we have used, there is an energy variable and a couple others that would be interesting to look at compared to the actual text sentiment analysis.\n\n\n\nEmotion of Each Album\n\n\nalbum\nsentiment\nn\n\n\n\n\nFREE I.H: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\ntrust\n56\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\nanticipation\n63\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\nsadness\n15\n\n\nPower\njoy\n59\n\n\nSingle\nanticipation\n33\n\n\nlet me do one more\nfear\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Score of Each Album\n\n\nalbum\nvalue\nn\n\n\n\n\nFREE I.H: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\n1\n37\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n2\n32\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\n-2\n8\n\n\nPower\n3\n44\n\n\nSingle\n-2\n28\n\n\nlet me do one more\n-1\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive vs. Negative Sentiment of Each Album\n\n\nalbum\nsentiment\nn\n\n\n\n\nFREE I.H: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\npositive\n85\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\nnegative\n61\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\nnegative\n16\n\n\nPower\nnegative\n111\n\n\nSingle\nnegative\n59\n\n\nlet me do one more\nnegative\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelations\nI also wanted to look at the correlations between some of the most common words in the songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun Fact!!\nIn the song “Pool Hopping” the first verse goes:\nIn every life there is a bell One rounded curve of time or tell I’m on the left half looking Over, over, over, uh-huh\nReferencing being on the left side of a a bell curve! That’s statistical and semi-relevant!"

MODIS views the entire Earth every 1-2 days.\n\nInSAR: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, is imaging that maps ground deformations. InSAR uses radar imaging that penetrates cloud and weather coverage to get accurate readings of the Earth’s surface.\n\nLandsat: The Landsat Satellite Program is a satellite that is constantly acquiring data, from space based imaging of moderate land monitoring. It captures multi-spectral images of the land surface.\n\nSentinel-2: is a Europe based satellite imagery program that uses 2 satellites in orbit for multi-spectral imaging of the land and vegetation.\n\nDrones: UAV Remote Sensing is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with sensors that are constantly scanning a specific area of the Earth’s surface when they are in the air. These UAV’s can be equipped with LiDAR sensors, MODIS sensors, InSAR sensors and many others. They are alternative to satellite imaging."

    "text": "Uses of Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing\n\nWhat is Image Classification?\nFrom viso.ai:\n“A computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of matrices, with the size of the matrix dependent on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification in a computer’s view is the analysis of this statistical data using algorithms. In digital image processing, image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called “classes.”\n\n\nHow does Object Detection in AI work?\nFrom Daten and Wissen:\n“AI identifies objects in images by looking for visual features that distinguish one object from another. These could be edges, textures, or shapes that appear in the image. Through machine learning, AI becomes proficient at recognizing these features, even in unfamiliar settings. It’s similar to how humans learn to recognize objects: through repeated exposure and pattern recognition. The more data the AI gets, the better it becomes at identifying objects, even in challenging environments like low light or busy scenes.”\n\n\nHow does AI do Pattern Recognition?\nFrom viso.ai:\n“AI pattern recognition using neural networks is currently the most popular method for pattern detection. Neural networks are based on parallel subunits referred to as neurons that simulate human decision-making. They can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of a huge number of simple processors with many interconnections (Neurons).\nThe most popular and successful form of machine learning using neural networks is deep learning, which applies deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to solve classification tasks.\nToday, neural network pattern recognition has the edge over other methods because it can change the weights repeatedly on iteration patterns. In recent years, deep learning has proven to be the most successful method to solve recognition tasks. For more information and detailed descriptions of what neural networks are all about, we recommend you read our guide about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.”\n\n\nHow does AI achieve Feature Extraction?\nFrom IBM:\n“First, the model takes in input data, then the feature extractor transforms the data into a numerical representation that can be used to compute the dimensionality reduction methods for feature extraction. These representations are stored in feature vectors for the model to perform algorithms for data reduction.”\n\n\nWhat is Data Fusion?\nFrom Windward:\n“Here’s how data fusion happens:\n\nData acquisition and validation: data is continuously collected from various sources and standardized for analysis. Before moving forward, it is validated to remove inaccuracies, and redundant or erroneous information.\nFeasibility and assignment: the validated data is evaluated to ensure it reflects realistic behavior patterns, after which it is assigned to the most appropriate entities, using advanced matching techniques.\nConflict resolution and refinement: in cases of conflicting data assignments, a scoring mechanism resolves any ambiguities. The data is then further refined to maintain the accuracy and integrity of entity paths.\nData optimization: the final step involves streamlining the dataset, retaining only the most relevant information to ensure efficient processing in downstream applications.”"

In elementary school most students spend time learning about the salmon cycle, even getting to raise their own fish. For this project we wanted to focus on something that was both interesting to us and held a bit of importance to our beloved home. Both of us were also intrigued by the prospect of this being someone’s job, going out and collecting this data. Over the course of this project we looked at the many different kinds of food that these juvenile chinhook salmon ate, how big they were,where these fish came from, and comparing the fish from hatcheries in various parts of the Pacific Northwest to the fish that were born in the wild. We examined the correlatory differences in the prey from both these sets of fish and the size of these fish.\n\n\n\nJuvenile Chinook salmon, Roger Tabor/USFWS, Public Domain, https://www.fws.gov/media/juvenile-chinook-salmon"

In elementary school most students spend time learning about the salmon cycle, even getting to raise their own fish. For this project we wanted to focus on something that was both interesting to us and held a bit of importance to our beloved home. Both of us were also intrigued by the prospect of this being someone’s job, going out and collecting this data. Over the course of this project we looked at the many different kinds of food that these juvenile chinhook salmon ate, how big they were,where these fish came from, and comparing the fish from hatcheries in various parts of the Pacific Northwest to the fish that were born in the wild. We examined the correlatory differences in the prey from both these sets of fish and the size of these fish.\n\n\n\nJuvenile Chinook salmon, Roger Tabor/USFWS, Public Domain, https://www.fws.gov/media/juvenile-chinook-salmon"

    "text": "Length of Fish and Prey Type\nFor our last size based graph we wanted to explore the length of the fish with how they correlate to the prey type eaten as compared to the weight graphs above. We also wanted to explore a graph with much more complication, and analyze it on many levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot going on in this graph, but also some pretty interesting takeaways. The overall boxplots show that length has the same correlation with prey type as weight. The light gray beeswarm dots show that the hatchery fish once again are shorter than the whole group. Finally, the colored dots show the longest fish grouped by each hatchery."

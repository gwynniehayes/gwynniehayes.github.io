    "text": "Materials and Methods\nThese data were collected by researchers at the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology (UMMS) Division of Reptiles and Amphibians, from specimens in their collection. The collection includes 2600 individual specimens that contain 757 different species from 52 different families. The frogs were measured in millimeters using digital calipers to determine length and width of each body parts. Each row represents a unique frog and only adult frogs were measured. Some species are represented as many as 9 times, though many individuals have only 5 or less observations, with this in mind we chose to represent the data on the family level.\nTo explore these data for our research question (below) we had to do some data manipulation to put it in a workable state. First, the data were filtered to just include Hylidae and Bufonidae families and any NA’s were removed, which lowered the data to 898 full rows. Families were also renamed to their common names, while Hylidae is technically a family of Tree frogs and their allies, we just chose to name them tree frogs for ease of understandability. Then, to remove size based colinearity all variables were divided by SVL; as a result, all explanatory variables in the project are described as “relative to body size”, and unit-less. For our logistic tests, we also multiplied the explanatory variables by 20 to display them as a 5% ratio to body size, to account for small ratio values. Summary statitics are a median (to account for high amount of outliers) with standard deviation to define spread. Lastly, we used this data to identify an optimal generalized logistic model using a stepwise analysis in both directions, which uses a two-sided p-value."

From this statistical analysis we found that the best way to predict a frog or a toad is by using 6 measurements: Body Size Ratios of lower leg length, lower arm length, head length, eye length naris-snout length, and an unratioed Snout-Vent Length. It is important to note that the first 3 variables: lower leg length, lower arm length and head length, are by far more important to the model than the last 3. Each of these three variables lowered the overal AIC (variability explained by the model) by many hundreds, wheras the addition of the latter 3 variables only lowered the AIC by a cumulative of 16.\nInterestingly, though it would seem that having longer eye length or naris snout length, with respect to body size, would raise the odds of being a tree frog (Figs. 2 + 3), the model displays the opposite, as the length increases the odds of being a tree frog is smaller. This is likely due to the minimial variability in these variables, and the way they interact with the other variables in the full model. If you have a full specimen we reccomend trying to use all 6 variables, but in a pinch, the measurements of lower leg, lower arm, and head length relative to body size will suffice.\nThough we used a step-wise exploratory method for arriving on our model, rather than testing specific variables of interest, the fact that measurements of lower leg length and lower arm length make a lot of sense in the context of the data. As discussed earlier, one of the most unique features to the tree frogs are their strong jumping legs. The fact that the odds of being a tree frog change by 21.64 times for every .05 increase in relative lower leg length strongly affirms the claim by Paris (2000). Our model also stated that the odds of being a tree frog change by .001 times for every .05 increase in lower arm length as a ratio to body size. This means that the trait of longer lower arms is highly specialized to toads, which strongly corroborates the connection made by Sanchez et. al (2010) of soil hardness and burrowing habits, and is a clear distinction between the two families.\nOne potential confounding variable to our data is that we do not know how these specimens were stored. The authors did not clairfy if specimins were stored in jars or as skeletons, this difference could warp measurements due to layers of skin and muscle, especially in smaller variables, such as naris-snout length. Furthermore, preserved specemins are known to shrink over time, despite the best preservation techniques, specimins of different ages could have shrunken or become deformed at different rates, warping them from their ‘true’ measurement, adding extra variability to the dataset.\nThis model can be generalized to identify frogs that fall in the family of Hylidae or Bufonidae, which limits its ability to identify an unknown frog specemin, though if it is known to fall into one of those two families, it could be especially useful then. More complex models could also be made to narrow down a frog from a wider selction of families or species. The source of the data library of specemins is proudly boasted to be ‘world wide’ though our spececific data is not connected to a location, so it is hard to say where in the world we can generalize this data to. If we assume the sampling of species and locations is random though, it could be feasible to generalize it to any species within these two families around the world.\nOne of the motivations behind our research was the declining population of frogs, which is still vastly misunderstood. With this analysis, we have identified some clear defining characteristcs to make the identification of diceased frogs easier. Furthermore, our model found clear evidence of family wide nich partioning in Tree frogs and True Toads. Tree frogs lower legs are longer and specialized for jumping between trees, while true toads lower arms are longer and specialized for digging burrows on the forest floor. Thus this model could be used to aid the conservation of frogs in a 2 fold manor. First, a specimen could be identified by a series of body measurements, and then linked to a location and larger dataset. Secondly, by identifying which traits are important in these specimins, we can begin to look for problems that relate to their specialization, such as in deforestatin or soil quality. This analysis could be done via a hot spot analysis, where a subject of interest is identified and then algorithmically analyzed to reveal spatial trends correlated and shows evidence of a phenomenon happening with a confidence level.\nFuture logistic models should work to assess differentiations of other families, and potentially explore specimens on a species level."

MODIS views the entire Earth every 1-2 days.\n\nInSAR: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, is imaging that maps ground deformations. InSAR uses radar imaging that penetrates cloud and weather coverage to get accurate readings of the Earth’s surface.\n\nLandsat: The Landsat Satellite Program is a satellite that is constantly acquiring data, from space based imaging of moderate land monitoring. It captures multi-spectral images of the land surface.\n\nSentinel-2: is a Europe based satellite imagery program that uses 2 satellites in orbit for multi-spectral imaging of the land and vegetation.\n\nDrones: UAV Remote Sensing is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with sensors that are constantly scanning a specific area of the Earth’s surface when they are in the air. These UAV’s can be equipped with LiDAR sensors, MODIS sensors, InSAR sensors and many others. They are alternative to satellite imaging."

    "text": "Uses of Artificial Intelligence in Remote Sensing\n\nWhat is Image Classification?\nFrom viso.ai:\n“A computer analyzes an image in the form of pixels. It does it by considering the image as an array of matrices, with the size of the matrix dependent on the image resolution. Put simply, image classification in a computer’s view is the analysis of this statistical data using algorithms. In digital image processing, image classification is done by automatically grouping pixels into specified categories, so-called “classes.”\n\n\nHow does Object Detection in AI work?\nFrom Daten and Wissen:\n“AI identifies objects in images by looking for visual features that distinguish one object from another. These could be edges, textures, or shapes that appear in the image. Through machine learning, AI becomes proficient at recognizing these features, even in unfamiliar settings. It’s similar to how humans learn to recognize objects: through repeated exposure and pattern recognition. The more data the AI gets, the better it becomes at identifying objects, even in challenging environments like low light or busy scenes.”\n\n\nHow does AI do Pattern Recognition?\nFrom viso.ai:\n“AI pattern recognition using neural networks is currently the most popular method for pattern detection. Neural networks are based on parallel subunits referred to as neurons that simulate human decision-making. They can be viewed as massively parallel computing systems consisting of a huge number of simple processors with many interconnections (Neurons).\nThe most popular and successful form of machine learning using neural networks is deep learning, which applies deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to solve classification tasks.\nToday, neural network pattern recognition has the edge over other methods because it can change the weights repeatedly on iteration patterns. In recent years, deep learning has proven to be the most successful method to solve recognition tasks. For more information and detailed descriptions of what neural networks are all about, we recommend you read our guide about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.”\n\n\nHow does AI achieve Feature Extraction?\nFrom IBM:\n“First, the model takes in input data, then the feature extractor transforms the data into a numerical representation that can be used to compute the dimensionality reduction methods for feature extraction. These representations are stored in feature vectors for the model to perform algorithms for data reduction.”\n\n\nWhat is Data Fusion?\nFrom Windward:\n“Here’s how data fusion happens:\n\nData acquisition and validation: data is continuously collected from various sources and standardized for analysis. Before moving forward, it is validated to remove inaccuracies, and redundant or erroneous information.\nFeasibility and assignment: the validated data is evaluated to ensure it reflects realistic behavior patterns, after which it is assigned to the most appropriate entities, using advanced matching techniques.\nConflict resolution and refinement: in cases of conflicting data assignments, a scoring mechanism resolves any ambiguities. The data is then further refined to maintain the accuracy and integrity of entity paths.\nData optimization: the final step involves streamlining the dataset, retaining only the most relevant information to ensure efficient processing in downstream applications.”"

    "text": "In Washington State, salmon are a big part of the water’s ecosystems and provide jobs and food to many people and animals. In elementary school most students spend time learning about the salmon cycle, even getting to raise their own fish. For this project we wanted to focus on something that was both interesting to us and held a bit of importance to our beloved home. Both of us were also intrigued by the prospect of this being someone’s job, going out and collecting this data. Over the course of this project we looked at the many different kinds of food that these juvenile chinhook salmon ate, how big they were,where these fish came from, and comparing the fish from hatcheries in various parts of the Pacific Northwest to the fish that were born in the wild. We examined the correlatory differences in the prey from both these sets of fish and the size of these fish.\n\n\n\nJuvenile Chinook salmon, Roger Tabor/USFWS, Public Domain, https://www.fws.gov/media/juvenile-chinook-salmon"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nOne of my favorite bands is called Illuminati Hotties, what I love about them is that all the songs are very different and unique. The main artist is named Sarah Tudzin and in her professional life she is a music producer for many much more popular artists. She also writes and produces her own music and what I think is really cool about it is she just has fun making a bunch of cool and unique sounds, that aren’t dictated by someone else.\nSome of my friends and I went to a concert for another artist called Pom Pom Squad almost 4 years ago at this point where we were first introduced to her and have been hooked ever since, one of the things we always talk about is the uniqueness of her music and the interesting and sometimes slightly disturbing lyrics she uses in her songs. This led me to wanting to do a text analysis of her song lyrics.\n\n\n\nData!\nThere was not a data set of her song lyrics as she is not a very famous artist so i made the maybe silly decision to scrape all the lyrics off the web myself and make my own data set. I did all of this in a document called MP4_cleaning.qmd because it was a lot of code that was not important to the actual project results, it is however linked in my github and on this website page.\nWhat I did was used the web page scraping functions that we made in class to make a similar function that I could input the names of the songs into. I first tried to do all the songs at once but was running into issues with my IP address getting blocked from requesting too much data so I had to break down the songs into smaller requests and I made 10 individual csv files that I then bind_row() into one full data set. This however was only the names of the songs and the lyrics and I wanted an album name which was a little more complicated because the website I used to get the lyrics did not have the album name on the page that the song lyrics were on. So I just did a bunch of if else statements to add the new column. This definitely was not the most efficient method of doing this but its what I did because it was more familiar for a part of the project that was completely unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n\nSong\nword\nalbum\n\n\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nall\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nmy\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nfavorite\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nsocks\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\nare\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n(You’re Better) Than Ever\ngetting\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what the data set looks like after I read it into this document and did some final cleaning!\n\nIlluminati Hotties have 5 albums and a couple singles that I am analyzing together as one “album”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet Me Do One More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFree I.H: This is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\nSome things I want to explore with in this data set are:\n\nMost common words in general, in each song and in each album\nSentient analysis of each album\nNetwork Graph and Correlation\n\n\n\n\nWord Counts\nI first wanted to just look at the most common word in all of her songs in general and found what was expected, words like “I”, “you” and “the” were the most commonly used words.\n\n\n\nMost Common Words for All Songs\n\n\nalbum\nword\nn\n\n\n\n\nPower\ni\n121\n\n\nlet me do one more\ni\n113\n\n\nKiss Yr Frenemies\ni\n100\n\n\nSingle\ni\n70\n\n\nFREE I.H: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For\nyou\n59\n\n\nNickel on the Fountain Floor\nyou\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo look at just the most common useful words I anti_joined my data set with the set of of smart stop words.

## Data Source

# Forest

For my numerical maps, I looked at the percentage of land covered in forest in the united states. I found this data in the USDA Forest Service FIA Annual Report, this report is a pdf where I extracted the values that I would need for this data set.

# Frogs

I wanted to look frogs for my categorical data. I found observations of frogs on the website, inaturalist where you can export observations based on specific criteria. I wanted to look at something more interesting then just the most common frog in each state so i looked at the most commonly observed frog that is deemed threatened.

  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = forest_cover), color = "black", linewidth = 0.2) +

alt text: This is a choropleth map of the United States that is looking a the percentage of land area that is covered by forest in each state. The x-axis is the longitude values of the United States which contain values -120 - -80. The y-axis the latitude values of the United States which contain values 25-50. This map is colored by the percentage forest covereage with the most coverage being a dark purple while the least coverage is a bright yellow. From this map we can see that states in the East have a higher percentage of forest coverage while states in the middle have a much lower percent forest coverage, then the west coast has a medium amount of forest coverage.
